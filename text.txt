# The Log

Once I stood tall in morning mist,
Arms reaching toward the sky,
My leaves would dance, my branches twist,
As seasons wandered by.

But time carved rings within my heart,
Each year a faithful mark,
Until the day I played my part
And fell with morning's lark.

Now I rest upon the ground,
A bridge across the stream,
Where children's laughter can be found
And lovers pause to dream.

My bark grows soft with emerald moss,
My hollow shelters mice,
What others might consider loss,
I call my sacrifice.

For in my stillness, life takes hold,
Mushrooms crown my head,
And stories that I'll never told
Are whispered in my stead.

From towering oak to fallen friend,
I've learned what trees all knowâ€”
That every end's another's blend,
And death makes flowers grow.
